This directory contains material that will let you try out AMPL's
table and scrolling-window facilities on a Microsoft Windows system
(W9x or NT).  Contents include

	ampl.exe	student AMPL processor

	ampltabl.dll	standard ODBC table handler
			for Microsoft Excel, Access, and other
			database programs that use ODBC

	cplex.exe	student CPLEX LP, MIP, and QP solver

	cplex110.dll	used by cplex.exe; must be in the same directory

	gurobi.exe	student GUROBI LP and MIP solver

	README.cplex	text file documenting use of cplex.exe

	README.gurobi	text file documenting use of gurobi.exe

	LICENSE.txt	license agreement for cplex.exe and cplex110.dll

	modinc		AMPL include command for easy access to the
			MODELS and MODELS/NLMODELS subdirectories.

	MODELS		subdirectory of examples from the AMPL book
			and papers

	MODELS/NLMODELS	nonlinear models assembled by Elena Bobrovnikova

	minos.exe	student MINOS nonlinear solver

	lpsolve.exe	LP and MIP solver (discussed below)

	sw.exe		provides a scrolling window with cut and paste
			to Win32 console binaries, such as the other
			.exe files listed above

	readme.sw	text file with more details about using sw.exe

	TABLES		subdirectory of example files mentioned in
			http://www.ampl.com/ampl/NEW/tables.html

Your can run by clicking on (or otherwise invoking) sw.exe in this
directory and typing "ampl".  Alternatively, you can move all the
.exe, .dll, and .sw files to a directory on your search PATH.

Aside from the TABLES directory, current versions of the above files
appear in directory http://www.netlib.org/ampl/student/mswin .

Many other examples of model and data files appear in the AMPL web
site, http://www.ampl.com/ampl/, often accompanied by helpful
discussions in .html files.  See

	http://www.ampl.com/ampl/EXAMPLES/index.html

for pointers to these examples.


ILOG has also kindly made its documentation on using AMPL and cplex
available as

	http://www.netlib.org/ampl/solvers/cplex/ampl110.pdf

Please note that ampl110.pdf refers to "cplexamp" rather than "cplex".
Unrestricted versions of cplex sold by ILOG/CPLEX are called
"cplexamp" when delivered.  You are free to name things as you wish
(with suitable changes to "option solver" lines in AMPL scripts if
necessary).  One approach that avoids changes to AMPL scripts is to
call the interactive CPLEX front end provided by ILOG/CPLEX "icplex"
rather than "cplex", and to use "cplex" for the solver that works with
AMPL.


Solver kestrel requires an internet connection and must be downloaded
separately from http://neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/kestrel.html.  With kestrel,
you run AMPL locally and access NEOS solvers over the internet.  More
details appear in http://www.ampl.com/ampl/REMOTE/ .  Three little
AMPL command scripts mentioned in that web page (kestrelsub,
kestrelret, and kestrelkill) appear in the models directory.


Solver lpsolve is based on Michel Berkelaar's lp_solve 4.0.1.0, which
is distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(Version 2.1, February 1999).  In accordance with this agreement,
the complete source from which lpsolve.exe was compiled is
available in directories

	http://www.netlib.org/ampl/solvers
and
	http://www.netlib.org/ampl/solvers/lpsolve

File lp_solve_4.0.tar.gz in the latter directory was copied from
ftp://ftp.es.ele.tue.nl/pub/lp_solve/lp_solve.tar.gz in Jan. 2003
and contains the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.


If you start AMPL in this directory, you can easily access any of
the examples in the MODELS or MODELS/NLMODELS directories if you
first say

	include modinc

or
	commands modinc;

This sets option ampl_include to look first in this directory, then
in the MODELS directory, then in MODELS/NLMODELS for files mentioned
in "include" phrases and "model", "data", or "commands" commands.
If you first start sw in this directory or are using a Command
Prompt window in this directory, you can alternatively type

	ampl modinc -

to start AMPL and have it read "modinc" before accepting keyboard
input (file -).  The examples in the TABLES directory have their
own "option ampl_include" commands, so you can one of the .run files,
such as diet.mdb.run, by typing

	include TABLES/diet.mdb.run

or simply invoking

	ampl TABLES/diet.mdb.run

(from sw or a Command Prompt window).
